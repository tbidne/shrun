-- NOTE: We used to test the default read-size of 16,000. However, this
-- test failed on CI for an interesting reason. Despite using the 'block'
-- strategy, the string ended up being split after 9,216 chars, instead of
-- the expected 16,000. My _guess_ is that the pipe capacity was exceeded
-- (this is system-dependent), so only 9,216 chars were available when the
-- read happened. Or, whatever, who knows.
--
-- In any case, the test was of low value since read-strategy is tested in
-- multiple other places, so we really do not _need_ this particular test.
-- Test determinism is more valuable here, so the test was removed.
