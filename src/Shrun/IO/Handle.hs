-- NOTE: [Completed vs. Partial Reads]
--
-- readHandle implements "complete vs. partial read detection" for the purposes
-- of making the file output's prettier (i.e. formatting). What follows is an
-- explanation.
--
-- First, we define a _complete_ read as a read that is newline terminated.
-- Otherwise we have a _partial_ read. Notice that we could have multiple
-- complete reads (i.e. multiple newlines in the same read) and a possible
-- partial read, if the entire result does not end in a newline.
--
-- Second, readHandle only implements this strategy when it receives an IORef
-- to store the partial result i.e. if its first param is 'Just'. Otherwise,
-- if it is 'Nothing', we implement the normal strategy which just returns
-- exactly what it reads, up to blockSize bytes.
--
-- Before we get to the implementation strategy, let's briefly look at what
-- we did _not_ do.
--
-- 1. One strategy (and possibly the most natural) is to stop unconditionally
--    appending newlines in the file log formatting, and instead just send
--    what the handle gives us. This would automatically do what we want, so
--    why not?
--
--    Consider what happens if the underlying program does not send _any_
--    newlines (e.g. programs that overwrite the same line). We will end up
--    building a single extremely long line. For this to be reasonable, we'd
--    want to implement some sort of cutoff e.g. "if we haven't read a newline
--    in some time or some data size, insert one".
--
-- 2. We also make no effort to make this sensible with multiple commands.
--    Because we log everything to a single file, there is no sensible way
--    to perform this formatting with multiple commands. To make this actually
--    work we would need to log each command to its own file, which is
--    possible, but would be a very invasive change, possibly with a
--    complicated implementation / interface.
--
-- Onto the implementation.
--
-- When we encounter a partial read, we save it in an IORef. In general, when
-- reading the handle, we check this ref, and if it is non-empty, we prepend
-- it to the first read in the handle. We implement a threshold cutoff, whereby
-- we print it anyway, so that we do not build up a massive string in memory.
