-- NOTE: We use standard Eq here and put the equivalence class Ord on a
-- newtype (CommandOrd) because some of tests verify all CommandP fields
-- match our expectations. Implementing Eq/Ord in terms of index would
-- weaken tests and hide bugs (e.g. potential legend refactors had a bug
-- with the key, but the tests missed this when Eq was determined by index).
--
-- We also intentionally do not implement Ord, as such uses should
-- probably use CommandOrd, and we do not want to accidentally use the
-- derived Ord.
