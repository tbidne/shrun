-- | WithDisabled augments some type with a 'disabled' option. Isomorphic to
-- 'Maybe', it exists to distinguish "missing" vs. explicitly
-- disabled. For instance, we want to be able to disable the parameter
-- notify-action, but we do not want to add another constructor to it, because
-- we want NotifyAction to represent definite actions, hence the user config
-- (CLI and Toml) is 'Maybe (Disabled NotifyAction)' i.e.
--
-- - Just Disabled: NotifyAction explicitly disabled.
-- - Nothing: NotifyAction not given.
-- - Just Enabled _: NotifyAction explicity enabled.
--
-- We have this for the purposes of allowing CLI the override whatever
-- Toml parameter might exist, while at shrun's runtime it is merged to
-- 'Maybe NotifyAction':
--
-- - Nothing: Notifications off.
-- - Just NotifyAction: Notifications on.
