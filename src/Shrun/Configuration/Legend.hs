-- | Returns a list of 'Text' commands, potentially transforming a
-- given string via the `LegendMap` @legend@.
--
-- Given a command string /s/, we first check if /s/ exists as a key in
-- @legend@. If it does not, we return /s/. If there is a key matching
-- /s/, i.e.,
--
-- @
-- legend = fromList [...,(s, v),...]
-- @
--
-- where \(v = v_1,,\ldots,,v_n\), then we recursively search on each
-- \(v_i\). We stop and return \(v_i\) when it does not exist as a key in the
-- map.
